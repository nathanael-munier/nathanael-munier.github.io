  abstract = {Single source localization from low-pass filtered measurements is ubiquitous in optics, wireless communications 
  and sound processing. We analyze the performance of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) in this context with additive 
  white Gaussian noise. We derive necessary conditions and sufficient conditions on the maximum admissible noise level to 
  reach a given precision with high probability. The two conditions match closely, with a discrepancy related to the 
  conditioning of a noiseless cost function. They tightly surround the Cramér–Rao lower bound for low noise levels. 
  However, they are significantly more precise to describe the performance of the MLE for larger levels. As an outcome, 
  we obtain a new criterion for the design of point spread functions in single molecule microscopy.},

 URL = {https://www.jstor.org/stable/48766118},
 abstract = {Let p and q be distinct primes, and let Xp,q be the (q + 1)-
regular graph whose nodes are supersingular elliptic curves over Fp and whose
edges are q-isogenies. For fixed p, we compute the distribution of the ℓ-Sylow
subgroup of the sandpile group (i.e. Jacobian) of Xp,q as q → ∞. We find that
the distribution disagrees with the Cohen–Lenstra heuristic in this context.
Our proof is via Galois representations attached to modular curves. As a
corollary, we give an upper bound on the probability that the Jacobian is
cyclic, which we conjecture to be sharp.},

  abstract = {The most popular networks used for cell segmentation (e.g. Cellpose, Stardist, HoverNet,...) rely on a prediction of a
distance map. It yields unprecedented accuracy but hinges on fully annotated datasets. This is a serious limitation to
generate training sets and perform transfer learning. In this paper, we propose a method that still relies on the distance
map and handles partially annotated objects. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in the contexts of
frugal learning, transfer learning and regular learning on regular databases. Our experiments show that it can lead to
substantial savings in time and resources without sacrificing segmentation quality. The proposed algorithm is embedded
in a user-friendly Napari plugin.},

the type Φ(x) = y, where Φ is a continuous application. This equation appears in domains such as (blind) inverse problems, data
assimilation, or optimal control. When the solution is not unique, it may be important to inform the user about the set of plausible
solutions. We propose here an algorithm to locally describe a set of solutions of this equation. It is essentially based on automatic
differentiation and on a local parameterization of the solution manifold. We illustrate the interest of this approach on two toy
examples.},

  PDF = {https://hal.science/hal-04744486v1/document},
  abstract = {Given a forward mapping Φ : RN → RM , the region {x ∈ RN , ∥Φ(x) −
y∥2 ≤ ε}, where y ∈ RM is a given vector and ε ≥ 0 is a perturbation am-
plitude, represents the set of all possible inputs x that could have produced
the measurement y within an acceptable error margin. This set reflects
the inherent uncertainty or indeterminacy in recovering the true input x
solely from the noisy observation y, which is a key challenge in inverse
problems. In this work, we develop a numerical algorithm called Jackpot
(Jacobian Kernel Projection Optimization) which approximates this set
with a low-dimensional adversarial manifold. The proposed algorithm
leverages automatic differentation, allowing it to handle complex, high
dimensional mappings such as those found when dealing with dynamical
systems or neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our al-
gorithm on various challenging large-scale, non-linear problems including
parameter identification in dynamical systems and blind image deblurring.
The algorithm is integrated within the Python package deepinv.},
