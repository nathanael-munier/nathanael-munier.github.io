with Adversarial Manifolds},
  author={Munier, Nathana{\"e}l and Soubies, Emmanuel and Weiss, Pierre},

  abstract = {Given a forward mapping $$ \Phi : \mathbb{R}^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^M $$ , the region $$ \{x \in \mathrm{R}^N\}, \, || \Phi(x) -
y ||^2 \le \epsilon \} $$, where $$ y \in \mathrm{R}^M $$ is a given vector and $$ \epsilon \le 0 $$ is a perturbation am-
plitude, represents the set of all possible inputs $$ x$$  that could have produced
the measurement $$y$$ within an acceptable error margin. This set reflects
the inherent uncertainty or indeterminacy in recovering the true input $$x$$
solely from the noisy observation $$y$$, which is a key challenge in inverse
problems. In this work, we develop a numerical algorithm called Jackpot
(Jacobian Kernel Projection Optimization) which approximates this set
with a low-dimensional adversarial manifold. The proposed algorithm
leverages automatic differentation, allowing it to handle complex, high
dimensional mappings such as those found when dealing with dynamical
systems or neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our al-
gorithm on various challenging large-scale, non-linear problems including
parameter identification in dynamical systems and blind image deblurring.
The algorithm is integrated within the Python package deepinv.}

  author={Munier, Nathana{\"e}l and Soubies, Emmanuel and Weiss, Pierre},

  MONTH = Oct,
  PDF = {https://hal.science/hal-04753218/document},
  abstract = {Inverse problem solvers are mappings S : Y → X , where Y is the space
of measurements and X the space of signals we wish to recover. We propose a
simple algorithm to visualize the main instability of a solver implemented within
an automatic differentiation framework. We justify it through simple considerations
and illustrate its behavior on a deconvolution problem solved with a neural network
based reconstruction method. The proposed algorithm can be used to provide addi-
tional insights on the properties of inverse problem solvers, and can be viewed as a
simple uncertainty quantification technique.}
