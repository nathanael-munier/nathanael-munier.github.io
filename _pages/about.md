Here you are at my personal page. I am a postdoctoral researcher currently employed at University of Graz in Austria. I am part of the Department of Mathematics and scientific computing, working in the research group [Inverse problems and Mathematical Imaging](https://mathematik.uni-graz.at/en/our-research/inverse-problems-and-mathematical-imaging/).
Here is a map showing my scientific journey, both geographical and thematic.
